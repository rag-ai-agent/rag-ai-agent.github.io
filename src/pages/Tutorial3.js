          This tutorial covers the basics of making an AI chatbot using OpenAI's API Services. After this tutorial you will be able to make your own working chatbot. You will also familiarize the concepts of, virtual environments, environment variables, API calling, role assignment, making a chatbot with and without memory, and building simple applications. You can follow along with the following video or through the written tutorial below.

        <h2>Create an virtual environment, and install the requirered packages</h2>
        <p>
          We'll start by creating a virtual environment for our project to live in. Virtual environments in Python isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects, ensuring consistent environments and easier maintenance. Additionally, using a requirements.txt file is considered a best practice because it provides a clear record of all required packages, making setups reproducible and collaboration smoother. To create and activate the virtual environment, enter the following into your terminal.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>P.S. The virtual environment is named ai in this tutorial, but you can use any name you want.</p>

        <p>
          This requirements file may be small at the moment, but as you work on larger projects with more dependencies, you will find it to be an invaluable component to your projects that will enable you to control which versions of dependencies you use. It will also make tracking which libraries need to be installed to replicate your project. Start by creating a file called requirements.txt in your root folder and putting the following requirements in it. You can then easily install all the required components into your virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal.

        <h2>Store your API key in an environment variable and Build your chatbot!</h2>
        <p>
        A .env file is commonly used to store environment variables such as API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive configuration details. By keeping these values separate from the source code, you maintain security and flexibility. This approach also makes it straightforward to switch between different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) without modifying your codebase. Create a file in your root directory named .env and copy the following code into it. You are going to need to replace "YOUR API KEY HERE" with your own API key which you can get from <a href="https://login.pinecone.io/login?state=hKFo2SB1SGxhWTZwNVNNNVcyZF9zb1haVU0xWkh6TWF1NW1Ld6FupWxvZ2luo3RpZNkgS1Z2cnh5RFF6bk5FdTdyQm8tdkdkT29xSzB5WG5iemujY2lk2SBUOEkyaEc2Q2FaazUwT05McWhmN3h6a1I0WmhMcVM0Qw&client=T8I2hG6CaZk50ONLqhf7xzkR4ZhLqS4C&protocol=oauth2&audience=https%3A%2F%2Fus-central1-production-console.cloudfunctions.net%2Fapi%2Fv1&scope=openid%20profile%20email%20read%3Acurrent_user&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.pinecone.io&sessionType=signup&response_type=code&response_mode=query&nonce=NW8wMC13OXlaRjlDNXNfSWxtWVZtdTVIYkFuRS4tV2o5dk8xSVAuck5NQQ%3D%3D&code_challenge=3eV-pnh-LqR6sJBDUgT9Uwhhx1f5AbpfMCdgZhYyU5Y&code_challenge_method=S256&auth0Client=eyJuYW1lIjoiYXV0aDAtcmVhY3QiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoiMS4xMi4xIn0%3D">Pinecone</a>

        Now, to make your chatbot, copy the following code into a file in your root directory. This code snippet demonstrates how to use environment variables and the OpenAI client to build a simple, joke-loving chatbot. By loading credentials from the .env file, the script creates a chat function that sends user input to a humorous GPT-4â€“like model. It then prints back witty responses in real-time until the user decides to quit. However, the chatbot has no memory.
